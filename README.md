# 11th RDKit UGM

12-14 October 2022

Berlin, Germany

## Calls for talks and posters:

The application phase is now closed.

## Draft agenda

The current version of the agenda, including the list of lightning talks, is coming soon

## COVID and hygiene regulations

The current regulations (as of October 1st) in the state of Berlin are quite lax, and no specific restrictions are in place for large meetings. Participants do not need to test, nor wear masks. We would nevertheless appreciate if you would test yourselves prior to coming to the meeting, and stay home if you have any suspicious symptoms!
