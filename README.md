# 11th RDKit UGM

12-14 October 2022

Berlin, Germany

## Calls for talks and posters:

The application phase is now closed.

## Draft agenda

The current version of the agenda, including the list of lightning talks, is in
the file Info/Agenda.pdf in this repo

## COVID and hygiene regulations

First the official stuff: the current regulations (as of October 1st) in the
state of Berlin are quite lax, and no specific restrictions are in place for
large meetings. 

And now a message from the organizers: 
We know that the incidence of COVID infections is going up and we really don't
want to have the UGM turn into a super-spreader event, so we are asking you for
help. We would like you to think of the health of the other people at the
meeting. If you have any doubts about whether or not you are infected, please
test yourself *and* wear a mask the entire time you're in the conference space
(except when eating and drinking). 

Needless to say: if you have an active infection you should *not* come to the
conference space; let Greg or Floriane know via email or on discord and we will
send you the zoom links so that you can join virtually.

Hopefully everyone is vaccinated, so anyone who does end up getting infected at
the UGM (and we really, really hope that there are none) is unlikely to have a
serious case.
